We were delighted to work on the new TedxBrighton site.

Taking the content from the original site and working it up into a melting pot of content, ideas and brand was a lot of fun. Based on Wordpress the Ted team already knew how to get cracking with adding and editing content.

Fully responsive - site the focuses on showcasing the upcoming event whilst providing a place to watch talks for years gone by.
